# Caesar-Cipher-in-Jupyter-Notebook

## Overview
This project implements the Caesar Cipher, an ancient encryption technique, in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. The Caesar Cipher works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a set amount, defined by a key. This implementation allows for both encoding and decoding of text.

## Features
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Supports both encoding and decoding text.
- **Case Preservation**: Maintains the original case (uppercase or lowercase) of the text.
- **Non-alphabetic Character Handling**: Non-alphabetic characters are not altered, preserving spaces, punctuation, and numbers.

## Requirements
To run this Jupyter Notebook, you will need:
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
